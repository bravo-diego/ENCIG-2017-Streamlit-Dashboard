### What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an open-source Python framework to create data applications in an intuitive and simple way with just a few lines of code. It allows you to deploy and share your Streamlit apps through the Streamlit Community Cloud platform. It's an excellent tool for sharing your findings from machine learning and data science projects.

### About the Data

"*The National Survey on Governmental Quality and Impact (ENCIG) 2017 was conducted from November 6th to December 15th, 2017. Its aim is to collect information on experiences and perceptions of the population on public procedures and services provided by different government levels, including public security and justice services, to provide elements to make public policy decisions.*" National Institute of Statistics and Geography of Mexico (INEGI).

### About the Project

This repository is part of the **Data Science** Capstone Project, a course part of the **MSc Statistical Computing Program** at **Mathematics Research Center** (more info at [*Maestria en Computo Estadistico CIMAT Monterrey*](https://mce.cimat.mx/es)). The main objective of this project was to learn how to handle **categorical data**, focusing on statistical methods such as **Correspondence Analysis** (CA) and its extension, **Multiple Correspondence Analysis** (MCA), to gain insights and understand the data. The dashboard was created to share the main findings for an audience with no prior statistical experience. It is important to mention that the results obtained from the CA and MCA analyses support the findings from the exploratory and descriptive analyses. Therefore, understanding the fundamentals of these statistical tools is crucial for understand and handle the data in a simple way.
